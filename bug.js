This error occurs when using the useState hook in React Native with an object as the initial state.  When you attempt to update only a portion of the object, React Native might not re-render the component because the object reference remains the same.  This is because Javascript uses object references instead of copying the entire object.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [myObject, setMyObject] = useState({ name: 'John', age: 30 });

  const updateName = () => {
    setMyObject({ ...myObject, name: 'Jane' }); // Incorrect - object reference doesn't change
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{myObject.name}</Text> <Text>{myObject.age}</Text>
      <Button title="Update Name" onPress={updateName} />
    </View>
  );
};
```
